Hello!

These patches add simple ioctl(2) support to Landlock.

Objective
~~~~~~~~~

Make ioctl(2) requests restrictable with Landlock,
in a way that is useful for real-world applications.

Proposed approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduce the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL right, which restricts the use
of ioctl(2) on file descriptors.

We attach IOCTL access rights to opened file descriptors, as we
already do for LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE.

If LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL is handled (restricted in the ruleset),
the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL access right governs the use of all IOCTL
commands.

We make an exception for the common and known-harmless IOCTL commands
FIOCLEX, FIONCLEX, FIONBIO and FIOASYNC.  These IOCTL commands are
always permitted.  Their functionality is already available through
fcntl(2).

If additionally(!) the access rights LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE,
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE or LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR are
handled, these access rights also unlock some IOCTL commands which are
considered safe for use with files opened in these ways.

As soon as these access rights are handled, the affected IOCTL
commands can not be permitted through LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL any
more, but only be permitted through the respective more specific
access rights.  A full list of these access rights is listed below in
this cover letter and in the documentation.

I believe that this approach works for the majority of use cases, and
offers a good trade-off between Landlock API and implementation
complexity and flexibility when the feature is used.

Current limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this patch set, ioctl(2) requests can *not* be filtered based on
file type, device number (dev_t) or on the ioctl(2) request number.

On the initial RFC patch set [1], we have reached consensus to start
with this simpler coarse-grained approach, and build additional IOCTL
restriction capabilities on top in subsequent steps.

Notable implications of this approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Existing inherited file descriptors stay unaffected
  when a program enables Landlock.

  This means in particular that in common scenarios,
  the terminal's IOCTLs (ioctl_tty(2)) continue to work.

* ioctl(2) continues to be available for file descriptors acquired
  through means other than open(2).  Example: Network sockets,
  memfd_create(2), file descriptors that are already open before the
  Landlock ruleset is enabled.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Starting a sandboxed shell from $HOME with samples/landlock/sandboxer:

  LL_FS_RO=/ LL_FS_RW=. ./sandboxer /bin/bash

The LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL right is part of the "read-write" rights
here, so we expect that newly opened files outside of $HOME don't work
with most IOCTL commands.

  * "stty" works: It probes terminal properties

  * "stty </dev/tty" fails: /dev/tty can be reopened, but the IOCTL is
    denied.

  * "eject" fails: ioctls to use CD-ROM drive are denied.

  * "ls /dev" works: It uses ioctl to get the terminal size for
    columnar layout

  * The text editors "vim" and "mg" work.  (GNU Emacs fails because it
    attempts to reopen /dev/tty.)

IOCTL groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To decide which IOCTL commands should be blanket-permitted we went
through the list of IOCTL commands mentioned in fs/ioctl.c and looked
at them individually to understand what they are about.  The following
list is for reference.

We should always allow the following IOCTL commands, which are also
available through fcntl(2) with the F_SETFD and F_SETFL commands:

 * FIOCLEX, FIONCLEX - these work on the file descriptor and
   manipulate the close-on-exec flag
 * FIONBIO, FIOASYNC - these work on the struct file and enable
   nonblocking-IO and async flags

The following commands are guarded and enabled by either of
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE, LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE or
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR, once one of them is handled
(otherwise by LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL):

 * FIOQSIZE - get the size of the opened file
 * FIONREAD - get the number of bytes available for reading (the
   implementation is defined per file type)
 * FIGETBSZ - get file system blocksize

The following commands are guarded and enabled by either of
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE or LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE,
once one of them is handled (otherwise by LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL):

 * FS_IOC_FIEMAP - get information about file extent mapping
   (c.f. https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/fiemap.txt)
 * FIBMAP - get the file system block numbers underlying a file
 * FIDEDUPERANGE, FICLONE, FICLONERANGE - manipulating shared physical storage
   between multiple files.  These only work on some COW file systems, by design.
 * FS_IOC_RESVSP, FS_IOC_RESVSP64, FS_IOC_UNRESVSP, FS_IOC_UNRESVSP64,
   FS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE: Backwards compatibility with legacy XFS
   preallocation syscalls which predate fallocate(2).

The following commands are also mentioned in fs/ioctl.c, but are not
handled specially and are managed by LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL together
with all other remaining IOCTL commands:

 * FIFREEZE, FITHAW - work on superblock(!) to freeze/thaw the file
   system. Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
 * Accessing file attributes:
   * FS_IOC_GETFLAGS, FS_IOC_SETFLAGS - manipulate inode flags (ioctl_iflags(2))
   * FS_IOC_FSGETXATTR, FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR - more attributes

Related Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenBSD's pledge(2) [2] restricts ioctl(2) independent of the file
descriptor which is used.  The implementers maintain multiple
allow-lists of predefined ioctl(2) operations required for different
application domains such as "audio", "bpf", "tty" and "inet".

OpenBSD does not guarantee ABI backwards compatibility to the same
extent as Linux does, so it's easier for them to update these lists in
later versions.  It might not be a feasible approach for Linux though.

Open questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Can the FIONREAD IOCTL command number be overloaded?

   We allow the use of FIONREAD quite liberally, but for non-regular files, this
   IOCTL command can also be implemented in the VFS layer.  It is *technically*
   possible that file implementations overload the FIONREAD IOCTL number for
   other purposes which we don't want to permit.

   With what certainty can we assume that FIONREAD implementations are actually
   implementing that FIONREAD functionality?  If it were to happen anyway, would
   that be considered a kernel bug that has to be fixed?

 * I still need to write a test for the COW file system "reflink" IOCTLs, but it
   felt like the changes in V9 of the patch set were already large enough to
   send them out.

Changes
~~~~~~~

V10:
 * Major change: only restrict IOCTL invocations on device files
   * Rename access right to LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_DEV
   * Remove the notion of synthetic access rights and IOCTL right groups

V9:
 * in “landlock: Add IOCTL access right”:
   * Change IOCTL group names and grouping as discussed with Mickaël.
     This makes the grouping coarser, and we occasionally rely on the
     underlying implementation to perform the appropriate read/write
     checks.
     * Group IOCTL_RW (one of READ_FILE, WRITE_FILE or READ_DIR):
       FIONREAD, FIOQSIZE, FIGETBSZ
     * Group IOCTL_RWF (one of READ_FILE or WRITE_FILE):
       FS_IOC_FIEMAP, FIBMAP, FIDEDUPERANGE, FICLONE, FICLONERANGE,
       FS_IOC_RESVSP, FS_IOC_RESVSP64, FS_IOC_UNRESVSP, FS_IOC_UNRESVSP64,
       FS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE
   * Excempt pipe file descriptors from IOCTL restrictions,
     even for named pipes which are opened from the file system.
     This is to be consistent with anonymous pipes created with pipe(2).
     As discussed in https://lore.kernel.org/r/ZP7lxmXklksadvz+@google.com
   * Document rationale for the IOCTL grouping in the code
   * Use __attribute_const__
   * Rename required_ioctl_access() to get_required_ioctl_access()
 * Selftests
   * Simplify IOCTL test fixtures as a result of simpler grouping.
   * Test that IOCTLs are permitted on named pipe FDs.
   * Test that IOCTLs are permitted on named Unix Domain Socket FDs.
   * Work around compilation issue with old GCC / glibc.

     Thanks to Huyadi <hu.yadi@h3c.com>, who pointed this out in
     https://lore.kernel.org/all/f25be6663bcc4608adf630509f045a76@h3c.com/
     and Mickaël, who fixed it through #include reordering.
 * Documentation changes
   * Reword "IOCTL commands" section a bit
   * s/permit/allow/
   * s/access right/right/, if preceded by LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_*
   * s/IOCTL/FS_IOCTL/ in ASCII table
   * Update IOCTL grouping documentation in header file
 * Removed a few of the earlier commits in this patch set,
   which have already been merged.

V8:
 * Documentation changes
   * userspace-api/landlock.rst:
     * Add an extra paragraph about how the IOCTL right combines
       when used with other access rights.
     * Explain better the circumstances under which passing of
       file descriptors between different Landlock domains can happen
   * limits.h: Add comment to explain public vs internal FS access rights
   * Add a paragraph in the commit to explain better why the IOCTL
     right works as it does

V7:
 * in “landlock: Add IOCTL access right”:
   * Make IOCTL_GROUPS a #define so that static_assert works even on
     old compilers (bug reported by Intel about PowerPC GCC9 config)
   * Adapt indentation of IOCTL_GROUPS definition
   * Add missing dots in kernel-doc comments.
 * in “landlock: Remove remaining "inline" modifiers in .c files”:
   * explain reasoning in commit message

V6:
 * Implementation:
   * Check that only publicly visible access rights can be used when adding a
     rule (rather than the synthetic ones).  Thanks Mickaël for spotting that!
   * Move all functionality related to IOCTL groups and synthetic access rights
     into the same place at the top of fs.c
   * Move kernel doc to the .c file in one instance
   * Smaller code style issues (upcase IOCTL, vardecl at block start)
   * Remove inline modifier from functions in .c files
 * Tests:
   * use SKIP
   * Rename 'fd' to dir_fd and file_fd where appropriate
   * Remove duplicate "ioctl" mentions from test names
   * Rename "permitted" to "allowed", in ioctl and ftruncate tests
   * Do not add rules if access is 0, in test helper

V5:
 * Implementation:
   * move IOCTL group expansion logic into fs.c (implementation suggested by
     mic)
   * rename IOCTL_CMD_G* constants to LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_GROUP*
   * fs.c: create ioctl_groups constant
   * add "const" to some variables
 * Formatting and docstring fixes (including wrong kernel-doc format)
 * samples/landlock: fix ABI version and fallback attribute (mic)
 * Documentation
   * move header documentation changes into the implementation commit
   * spell out how FIFREEZE, FITHAW and attribute-manipulation ioctls from
     fs/ioctl.c are handled
   * change ABI 4 to ABI 5 in some missing places

V4:
 * use "synthetic" IOCTL access rights, as previously discussed
 * testing changes
   * use a large fixture-based test, for more exhaustive coverage,
     and replace some of the earlier tests with it
 * rebased on mic-next

V3:
 * always permit the IOCTL commands FIOCLEX, FIONCLEX, FIONBIO, FIOASYNC and
   FIONREAD, independent of LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL
 * increment ABI version in the same commit where the feature is introduced
 * testing changes
   * use FIOQSIZE instead of TTY IOCTL commands
     (FIOQSIZE works with regular files, directories and memfds)
   * run the memfd test with both Landlock enabled and disabled
   * add a test for the always-permitted IOCTL commands

V2:
 * rebased on mic-next
 * added documentation
 * exercise ioctl(2) in the memfd test
 * test: Use layout0 for the test
